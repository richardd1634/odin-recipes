    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic holiday ham is as easy as it is impressive. Learn everything you need to know to cook a whole ham for special occasions like Christmas and Easter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>3/4 cup water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 whole star anise</li>
      <li>12 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1(7 pound) country-style ham</li>
      <li>1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Pour water, star anise, and cloves into the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a roasting rack into the pan over the eater, anise, and cloves; place ham on rack. Cut 1/4-Inch deep slashes 1/2-Inch apart lengthwise and crosswise across the top of the entire ham.</li>
      <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Whisk brown sugar, honey, mustard, vinegar, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until glaze has a thick, smooth consistency.</li>
      <li>Brush glaze all over ham. Continue baking ham, brushing glaze on every 20 minutes, until glaze is deep golden and ham is heated through, about 2 hours 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Use a kitchen torch to heat the glaze on the ham until it is crispy and caramelized, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
